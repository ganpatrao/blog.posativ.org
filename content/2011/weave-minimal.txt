The first time I tried to get a custom Firefox Sync server running, I used
[`server-full`](https://hg.mozilla.org/services/server-full/) and even though
I know python (the server is written in python), the configuration was highly
difficult. There's no click & install. You have to choose between Redis,
MySQL, PostgreSQL and Sqlite3. For most people, sqlite3 is quite fine. Sqlite
and sync-server config files have summed up almost 80 LoC. And you still don't
know how to authenticate unless you have already a LDAP server running.

There are some alternatives:
[ffpyweave](https://github.com/tolumak/ffpyweave), [django sync
server](https://github.com/jedie/django-sync-server/) and formerly
[weave-minimal](http://ymartin59.free.fr/wordpress/index.php/2011/03/05/my-own-firefox-sync-weave-server/)
too, written in PHP but not supported anymore. But I've forked the official
[`server-full`](https://hg.mozilla.org/services/server-full/) (well I
completely rewrote) to a easier installation without multiple backends
but completely relying on a simple sqlite database.

Requirements
============

- a web server with proxy or FastCGI/WSGI support
- python runtime (>= 2.5)
- shell access

Installation
============

    :::bash
    $ easy_install -U weave-minimal

Usage
=====

~~Currently, Firefox does not you create a user account on your own server.
I [filed a bug][1] in a week ago. Therefore you need to set up every account
manually:~~

The setup is exactly the same as the official way except you have to choose
*custom server* and enter the url of your server.

    :::bash
    $ weave-minimal -p 8080

The last command launches weave.py on port 8080. You can now configure mod_proxy
in your webserver of choice or you some mod_fastcgi magic. See [README.md][2]
for an example configuration.

For the Firefox Sync Setup see in [README.md][2], too.

Hints
=====

- using an SSL-encrypted server is recommended but not required
- Firefox never transmits browser data unencrypted, just your username/password
  are sent base64-encoded over the air (HTTP Basic Authentication).
- you can have multiple user per weave-minimal instance
- the user password is stored SHA1-hashed (first 16 characters) into the
  database filename `name.91dfd9ddb4198aff`.
- in case your web server sucks and does not send `HTTP_X_SCRIPT_NAME`, start
  `weave-minimal` with `--prefix=/url/prefix`.
