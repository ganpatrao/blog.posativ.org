Today, I did a short maintenance to my MacBook running OS X Lion. I found out, Macfuse is no longer supported and dead as well. But there is [OSXFUSE][1], which installs without any problems. OpenPGP does not work for Mail, too and since the release of Lion (that's about two months ago) there is [no GPG support][2]. Really embarrassing.
After I've updated to Lion, I had iTunes and QuickTime, carefully removed, installed again and [AppDelete][8] was unable to remove it. I've updated to the last version and could remove this crappy software again – waiting for the next OS X update m(

Since I am using a Mac, I am using [TotalFinder][3], because OS X' Finder sucks a lot. Every time I use it. It feels like you must not handle your files. Unfortunately TotalFinder looks like <del>shit</del> Chrome and I don't like Chrome's UI and prefer Safari's or Firefox' tabbing style. I did another search for a Finder replacement and ended up with [ForkLift][4] –  replacing [Transmit][5] and [Archiver][6] as well). To replace the Finder, I've made the following:

- first, we need the Finder's icon located in */System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/Resources/finder.png*
- convert it to an icon file (.icns) with `png2icns finder.icns finder.png`, which didn't work for me so I used this [cool web service][7]
- open you Applications folder, locate *ForkLift* and control-rightclick and select "show package content" and navigate to *Contents/Resources/*
- backup the existing *forklift.icns* and move your converted *finder.icns* to *forklift.icns*

Now your ForkLift icon is identical to Finder. Lets remove the Finder from Dock.app.

- `cd` to */System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/Resources/* and open *DockMenus.plist*.
- change "finder-quit" and/or "finder-running" (don't know, which one worked for me) to include

DockMenus.plist

	<dict>
	    <key>command</key>
	    <integer>1004</integer>
	    <key>name</key>
	    <string>REMOVE_FROM_DOCK</string>
	</dict>
	
- do `killall Dock` which didn't work for me or log out and in again to restart Dock.app
- now you can rightclick the Finder's icon and select remove from Dock
- stick ForkLift to Dock.app
