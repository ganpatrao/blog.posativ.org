# blog.posativ.org | acrylamid

This is my folder containing everything needed for my blog using
[Acrylamid][1] as static compiler. It features a JavaScript search,
Atom/RSS feed as well as a special feed only showing items tagged
as "planet".

## See it in action

    %> git clone https://github.com/posativ/blog.posativ.org.git
    %> acrylamid compile
    %> acrylamid view
    %> acrylamid deploy blog

Its the reason why I am developing [Acrylamid][1].
